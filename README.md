#  ngrx

## ngrx store overview (course 5)

1. change detection and the performance benefits that we get from using a single store or rather an observable approach to managing state in our applications . 

* a component doesn't really care where it gets data from . by default angular has a built in change detection strategy that it's tring to look in your component and it uses sometiong called a zone to be detect whether it needs to update or not  . now we can acturally use 'OnPush' changeDetectionStrategy to tell angular that our @inputs property will be 100% immutable . because of the patterns that we use with a single store we have our reducers which return pieces of new state . these new state are composed in an immutable way and we just simply use a selector to select a piece of state . So whenever that changes  we get it to our container components which then passed doen into stateless presentational component.

* So the beauty of using  the OnPush ChangeDetectionStrategy means that we're acturally comparing objects rather than checking properties and values(这就是使用 immutable 的好处，因为变化只是在自己原来的基础上产生的变化，具体可以看一下immutable) 

* So when we use our OnPush change detection strategy we're essentially telling angular to compare the references of objects rather than try work out what's changed with inside an object . No two objects are the same unless it's the same object , so essentially what will happen when we mutate(变化) some of our data and pass it back to the store , This  in effect will give us a brand new object 

* So angular can say does this object equal this object yes or no . if it's yes then clearly something hasn't changed and nothing will happen further down in that component . However if something has changed , those objects won't acturally equal each other there won't be of the same object identity , so this means angular can just essentially ignore all of the change detection and we can just use observables to push new changes down the component tree .

* We also get the route and feature module support , so we've got eagerly and we've got lazily loaded modules . Now in the application we're going to have a lazy loaded module and we'll use a for feature call on our storeModule which indicates to ngrx store what we have either an eagerly or a lazy loaded module now ngrx will support both of these out-of-the-box .

* we're going to take full advantage of using lazily loaded modules and ngrx behind the scenes when we load in an angular module will then bind itself to the parent store module which we can call the root module;

* a feature module delivers a cohesive set of functionality focused on a specific application need such as a user workflow, routing, or forms.
